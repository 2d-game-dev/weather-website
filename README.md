# weather-website
A website built with HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
This is my first public blog-style website, created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It's a work in progress â€” some elements like the navbar and footer are still incomplete, but I plan to return and improve them soon.

The goal of this project is to practice building and styling websites from scratch, while gradually adding more functionality and improving the layout.
